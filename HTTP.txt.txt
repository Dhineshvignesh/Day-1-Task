1. Write ablog on Difference b/t Http1.1 vs Http2

  Ans: HTTP/1.1. loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all
       the other resources behind it. In contrast,
 
      HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no 
      one resource blocks any other resource.
       
      While HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are mainly 'HTTP-over-TCP', HTTP/3 is done over QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections).

      The main issue with TCP is that before establishing a session between a client and the server, a TLS handshake 
      is needed to verify for a secure servers
