2. Write a blog about object and its internal representation in javascrip ?
   
    
       Ans: 1. A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior
            (properties and method)”. For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer,  
             Washing Machine etc. Take the case of cars. All cars have the same properties,  
             but the property values differ from car to car.


             2. Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection
                of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
               These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respect 
                ively, in the context of an object.
